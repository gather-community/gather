  # Our general approach to error handling in jobs is an opt-in approach to job retries.
  # So by default, if a job errors out, it will be reported to Sentry by the rescue_from
  # block below. If a particular job wants to retry on a given error, it can use the
  # retry_on handler. If all the retries fail, the exception will bubble up to here and
  # be reported to Sentry. The Sentry report will happen only after all retries fail, so
  # if observability of all errors is desired, they must be caught and reported manually.
  #
  # For retries, our standard best practice is to use:
  #     retry_on(ArgumentError, wait: :exponentially_longer) # default is 5 attempts
  #
  # Logging for the retry behavior can be seen in log/<environment>.log. The Delayed Job log
  # at log/delayed_job.log will always say "failed after 1 attempt" because the error only
  # is allowed to bubble up by ActiveJob on the final attempt. This is also why
  # max_attempts for Delayed Job is set to 1.
  #
  # The retry behavior described above has been tested manually and works.
