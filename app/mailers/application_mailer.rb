  # It is up to the mailer system, not the background job system,
  # to figure out how to send mail to a household or user,
  # and whether users have opted out of a given type of mail.
  # Mails to households should be addressed to all the household users, not to each user separately.
  #
  # Also filters out fake users so that emails are not sent to their fake addresses.
  # Also filters out unconfirmed email addresses for security purposes (note that confirmation/password/
  # invite emails are sent with the AuthMailer which doesn't inherit from this class).
  #
  # If self.community returns a non-nil value, sets the appropriate subdomain.
