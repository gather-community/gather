# Users are the key to the whole thing!

# Email confirmation info:
# Rules:
# * User must have email unless non-full-access or inactive
# * Email changes must be reconfirmed if user is already confirmed
# * Signing in with invitation code counts as confirmation since it proves email ownership
# * Directory only users can have emails (for e.g. reminders) but can't be confirmed
#   (this implies non-full-access user emails are NOT secure, but that should be OK)
#
# Sample Flows:
# 1. Adult created with unconfirmed email, signs in with invite, is confirmed
# 2. Adult created with unconfirmed email, admin changes email before sign-in, email change doesn't need
#    reconfirmation because not confirmed yet, user later signs in with invite, is confirmed
# 3. Confirmed adult deactivated, email removed (this unsets confirmation flag), new email added, user
#    reactivated, sent sign in invite, signs in, is confirmed
# 4. Unconfirmed adult deactivated, email removed, same as above
# 5. Unconfirmed adult deactivated, email stays in place, reactivated, same as above
# 6. Directory-only child created with no email, not confirmed, can't sign in, later converted to full access,
#    email must be added, still unconfirmed, sent sign in invite, etc.
# 7. Directory-only child created with email, not confirmed, can't sign in, later converted to full access,
#    sent sign in invite, signs in, is confirmed
