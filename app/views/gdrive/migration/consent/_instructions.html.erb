        <h3>Why do I have to select files?</h3>
        <p>
          Google wants to make sure you don't unwillingly grant apps like Gather access to your entire Google Drive.
          So it makes you pick the individual things you want to allow access to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seems like a good idea to us! Our goal is to make it as easy as we can for you to select the files
          you want to move. That's why we pre-fill the search box in the file picker with:
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>owner:me to:<%= org_user_id %></strong>
        </p>
          This means that only files shared with the
          community's Google account will show up, and those are the same files that we're asking for your
          help in moving.
