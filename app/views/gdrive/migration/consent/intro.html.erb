    <%= @community.name %> is using <a href="https://gather.coop">Gather</a>
    to reorganize its Google Drive files.
    Before, the community's files were owned by whoever created them. This can lead
    to accidental deletion of files when someone leaves the community.
    To prevent this, the community is moving all its files into a drive owned by the
    community.

    <% if @consent_request.file_count > 2 %>
      You own about <%= @consent_request.file_count %> files in the
      <%= link_to("old Google Drive folder", @operation.src_folder_url) %>
      for <%= @community.name %>.
    <% else %>
      You own at least one file in the
      <%= link_to("old Google Drive folder", @operation.src_folder_url) %>
      for <%= @community.name %>.
    <% end %>
  </p>
  <p class="cta">
    We need your permission to move them into the new drive.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will still retain access to the files as long as you are a member of the community.

    If you have questions, you can reach out to <%= link_to(@operation.contact_name, "mailto:#{@operation.contact_email}") %>,
    who is coordinating the reorganization process.
