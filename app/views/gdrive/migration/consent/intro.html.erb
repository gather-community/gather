  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    <%= @community.name %> is using <a href="https://gather.coop">Gather</a>
    to reorganize its Google Drive files.
    Currently, the community's files are owned by whoever created them. This can lead
    to accidental deletion of files when someone leaves the community.
    To prevent this, the community is moving all its files into a shared drive owned by the
    community.
  </p>
  <p class="cta">
    <% if @consent_request.file_count >= 2 %>
      You own about <%= @consent_request.file_count %> files in the
      <%= link_to("old Google Drive folder", @operation.src_folder_url) %>
      for <%= @community.name %>. We need your permission to move them into the new drive.
    <% else %>
      You own at least one file in the
      <%= link_to("old Google Drive folder", @operation.src_folder_url) %>
      for <%= @community.name %>. We need your permission to move it into the new drive.
    <% end %>
  </p>
  <p>
    You will still retain access to the files if you are a member of the community.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have questions or concerns, you can reach out to <%= link_to(@operation.contact_name, "mailto:#{@operation.contact_email}") %>,
    who is coordinating the reorganization process.
