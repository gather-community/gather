Dear <%= @name %>,

<%= @community.name %> is using Gather to reorganize its Google Drive files.

Currently, the community's files are owned by whoever created them. This can lead to accidental deletion of files when someone leaves the community!

To prevent this, the community is moving all its files into a shared drive owned by the community.

<% if @migration_request.file_count >= 2 %>
Your Google Account <%= @migration_request.google_email %> owns about <%= @migration_request.file_count %> files in the old Google Drive folder for <%= @community.name %>. We need your permission to move them into the new drive.
<% else %>
Your Google Account <%= @migration_request.google_email %> owns at least one file in the old Google Drive folder for <%= @community.name %>. We need your permission to move it into the new drive.
<% end %>

Please go here to help out: <%= gdrive_migration_request_url(token: @migration_request.token) %>

You will still retain access to the files if you are a member of the community. If you have questions or concerns, you can reach out to <%= @operation.contact_name %> at <%= @operation.contact_email %>, who is coordinating the reorganization process. If you'd rather not help with this effort, you can also opt out at the URL above.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
