  <h3>I'm not sure what 'drag' means</h3>
  <p>
    Click on the selected files and hold down your mouse button. Then move the mouse
    as shown in the video above.
  </p>
  <h3>I accidentally un-selected some of the files</h3>
  <p>
    No problem! Go back to <%= link_to("Step 3", gdrive_migration_request_step3_path) %>.
  </p>
  <h3>I don't want to change ownership</h3>
  <p>
    All files in <%= @community.name %>'s new Shared Drive are owned by the community,
    not any individual. This ensures that files don't take up any space in your personal Google Drive
    quota, and can't be accidentally deleted.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will still have access to the files if you are a current member of the community.
