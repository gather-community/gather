  <h3>I don't see 'Shared drives' under the 'All locations' list</h3>
  <p>
    Make sure you are signed into Google with the account <b><%= migration_request.google_email %></b>.
    If you still don't see 'Shared drives', try opening
    <%= link_to("this link", migration_request.file_drop_drive_url, target: "_blank") %>
    in a new tab, and then try this step again.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are still having trouble, contact
    <%= link_to(@operation.contact_name, "mailto:#{@operation.contact_email}") %>
    for help.

  <h3>I accidentally un-selected some of the files</h3>
  <p>
    No problem! Go back to <%= link_to("Step 2", gdrive_migration_request_step2_path) %>.
  </p>
  <h3>I don't want to change ownership</h3>
  <p>
    All files in <%= @community.name %>'s new Shared Drive are owned by the community,
    not any individual. This ensures that files don't take up any space in your personal Google Drive
    quota, and can't be accidentally deleted.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will still have access to the files if you are a current member of the community.
