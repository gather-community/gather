This is test message number <%= @counter %> for the Gather email system.

We send these emails to verify that the Mailman and mail server systems are functioning properly.

We use a third party email mailbox provider in order to simulate real conditions.

We send the email from a backround job, and in the same job, we check to see if the email from the last time the job executed has been received.

The email is sent over Gather's normal SMTP system to an email list on the staff Gather instance.

The email list is configured with our test email address as the only member.

If we find a received test email, we note its timestamp.

The /ping page gets the timestamp of the latest received email, and if it's too far in the past, we raise an alarm.

Isn't that neat?

Sincerely,

The Gather Team
